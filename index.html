            <P>
                My name is Sourav Das. I am the youngest child of my parents. I have two sisters. I
                am the only son of my perent. Therefore, all responsibilities of the family lie on my
                shoulders.
                I am 22 years old and studying at Khulna University of CSE . I am a self-driven and a
                self-motivated student. Once my father said to me that “Education is the most powerful weapon, one can
                conquer all hurdles of life using knowledge”.

                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
