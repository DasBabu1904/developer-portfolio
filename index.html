            <P>
                My name is Mahesh Shukla. I am the first child to my parents. I have three brothers and three sisters. I
                am the elder one among my brothers and sisters. Therefore, all responsibilities of the family lie on my
                shoulders.
                I am 20 years old and studying at Imperial College of Modern Sciences. I am a self-driven and a
                self-motivated student. Once my father said to me that “Education is the most powerful weapon, one can
                conquer all hurdles of life using knowledge”.
            </P>
